Experimental
------------

This project represents a collection of experimental code. They were either created
to test out ideas or to test out stuff I have been learning about. In the current
state some stuff will work as is, while other will probably need a missing library
or a data file. Also, there may be better solutions to some of the code in this
project, so I make no claim to the quality or usefulness to any of this.

I haven't really made any of this suitable for public consumption, so either treat
this as a treasure trove or a junk heap to sift through.

While most of this code I did write myself, it is possible there is code here that
was based on someone else's work. I try to reference the original source when I
remember, but sometimes that doesn't happen. One thing that is for sure, is that
anything in the 'src-3rdparty' folder has definitely been written by some else.

If you find any of this stuff useful let me know.
